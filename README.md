# House-Pricing-Advanced-Regression-
**Project Information** The project contains a house pricing dataset and a model that is built using Ridge and Lasso regression techniques.

**Project Background** A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. 
The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

**Project Statement** Performing a basic EDA on the dataset and then **Building a Machine Learning model using L1 and L2 regression models and also finding the optimum lambda value**.
